3. Create the following sub classes of Student class:

                1. GraduateStudent:

                        Override the study method

                        add any additional fields and methods if necessary

                2. UndergraduateStudent

                        Override the study method

                        add any additional fields and methods if necessary

                3. CydeoStudent:

                        Extra Variables:
                            batchNumber, groupNumber, programmingLanguage

                        Encapsulate all the fields

                        Add a constructor that can set all the fields

                                Condition:
                                    1. batchNumber and groupNumber should not be set to zero or negative
                                    2. programmingLanguage should not be set to null
                                    3. programmingLanguage should not empty


                        Override the eat, drink and sleep methods (programmingLanguage need to be included)

                        Override the toString method:
                                name, age, gender, studentId, fieldOfStudy, grade, schoolName, batchNumber, groupNumber, programmingLanguage should be included


                4. Create a class named StudentObjects:

                        Create the objects of each sub classes

                        test all the functions of each objects

                        Analyze the relationships between the classes
